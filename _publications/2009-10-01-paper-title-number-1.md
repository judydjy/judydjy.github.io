excerpt: '**Author** Jiayi Dong, Laura Kim <br/>
**Abstract**  This first all dielectric “quasi-BIC(Bound States in the Continuum) quantum sensing metasurface”
supports Guided-Mode Resonances, which achieves dual BIC at both the pump and illumination wavelength
of NV(Nitrogen Vacancy) centers. This greatly enhances the integration of utilizing NV centers for quantum
sensing, and due to the ultra high field enhancement and Q factor of the BICs, this dielectric metasurface greatly
facilitates the readout and detection of the OMDR(optically detected magnetic resonance) of NV centers'
