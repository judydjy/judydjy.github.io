This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).\

Resaerch Insterests
======
In pursuit of being a **condensed matter physics experimentalist**, my research is driven by the goal of developing robust and efficient methodologies for delving into the fundamental properties of novel materials with [STM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope), [MBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular-beam_epitaxy), [ARPES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle-resolved_photoemission_spectroscopy#) and *etc*.

Currently, I am foucused on several projects:

1. **World's First Four-Scanning Probe STM Construction**: We are now testing the temperature and pressure of the chambers and starting to prepare some samples.

2. **Dynamical Optical Quasicrystalline lattices with Tunable Geometry Phases**: I have completed the theoretical analysis regarding dynamical quasicyrstals and developed robust methodology to translate them while maintaining the same lattice geometry. Currently I am invited by [**Optica**](https://www.optica.org/) to write a corresponding paper to tell the story as the *First Author*.

3. **In-Situ STM-MBE-Interconnected System Construction**: My research includes simulation of [our lab](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huiz/index.html) by SolidWorks and design of Low-Temperature Comprehensive Platform. 

4. **Investigating Rare-Earth Compound with STM**: Currently I am searching the CDW features and critical point of a specific rare-earth compound with STM.
