This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).\

Resaerch Insterests
======
In pursuit of being a **Scholar in Nanophotonics Devices Design and Manufacture**, my research is driven by the goal investigating of the interaction between light and matter at the micro- and nanoscale and enhance and modulate it through structural and material design to achieve applications in fields such as optical information storage and display, quantum sensing, and quantum optics. My research primarily focuses on optical phenomena such as [BIC (Bounded States in the Continuum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state_in_the_continuum), [GMR (Guided-Mode Resonance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided-mode_resonance), and [LSPR (Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon_resonance)and *etc*.

Currently, I am foucused on several projects:

1. **Absorption-Based Diamond Spin Microscopy on a Dielectric Quantum Metasurface**: I have completed the Dielectric Quatum Metesurface design. It is the first all-dielectric quantum metasurface designed to attain an ultra-high Q factor and substantial field confinement in diamond, employing a quasi-BIC mode. The manufacturing and characterization processes are currently in progress, as I'm preparing a corresponding research paper with [Prof. Laura Kim](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/laura-kim/)to tell the story as the *First Author*.

3. **Fluorescence Emission Based on Bound States in the Continuum**: Currently I am investigating on the planar BIC metasurface design to modulate the fluorescence emission of typical fluorescence materials such as WS2 with [Prof. Yang Chen](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/chenyang/en/index.htm)
