excerpt: '**Author** Jiayi Dong, Laura Kim <br/>
**Abstract**  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a leading quantum sensor platform, combining exceptional sensitivity with nanoscale spatial resolution by optically detected magnetic resonance(ODMR). Because fluorescence-based ODMR techniques are limited by low photon collection efficiency and modulation contrast, there has been growing interest in infrared (IR)-absorption-based readout of the NV singlet state transition. IR readout can improve contrast and collection efficiency, but it has thus far been limited to long-path length geometries in bulk samples due to the small absorption cross section of the NV singlet state. Here, we propose to amplify the IR absorption by introducing a resonant diamond all-dielectric metasurface that concentrates the optical field near the diamond surface. This “quasi-BIC quantum sensing metasurface” supports Guided-Mode resonances and achieves desired balance between field localization and sensing volume to optimize spin readout sensitivity.'
